# monster_kingdoms
Monster Kingdoms is my final CS02 project from Las Positas College. This is a C++ game that uses Rock-Paper-Scissors mechanics. There are 4 "Kingdoms", each with three troop types:
<ol><li>Assassin: The assassin is a sneaky troop that can easily defeat Knights. However, soldiers are able to find and kill them.</li>
<li>Knight: The Knight is a bulky troop trained in combat that can easily wipe out Soldiers. However, they are vulnerable to the sneak attacks of Assassins.</li>
<li>Soldier: The Soldier is a common troop trained in combat. They are able to eliminate Assassins easily, but Knights can easily beat them in head-to-head combat</li></ol>
In simpler terms:<ol><li>Knights beat Soldiers</li><li>Soldiers beat Assassins</li><li>Assassins beat Knights</li></ol>
